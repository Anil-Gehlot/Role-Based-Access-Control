# **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) UI**

This project implements a **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** User Interface for managing users, roles, and permissions. It provides a secure and intuitive admin dashboard for administrators to handle role-based workflows efficiently.

## **Predefined Users and Roles**

The application starts with three predefined roles: **Admin**, **Editor**, and **Viewer**. Each role has specific permissions:

1. **Admin:**
   - Can add, delete, and manage users.
   - Can add roles, edit permissions for users, and delete them.

2. **Editor:**
   - Can only edit permissions of the users.
   - Cannot add or delete users.

3. **Viewer:**
   - Can only view the user data.
   - Cannot add, delete, or edit users or permissions.
